# Donors_Choose
The goal of the competition is to predict whether or not a DonorsChoose.org project proposal submitted by a teacher will be approved, using the text of project descriptions as well as additional metadata about the project, teacher, and school. DonorsChoose.org can then use this information to identify projects most likely to need further review before approval. This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks. The first notebook deals with the EDA an data visualization using TSNE. The second notebook deals with three different deep learning architectures which were built by applying LSTM and CNN1D on the textual and categorical data.
